                I won three national first prizes in the field of robotics in
                2023, with two championships and one bronze medal.
              </p>

                In the 2023 RoboCup China
                tournament（2023RoboCup机器人世界杯中国赛）, to realize a
                general service robot that can respond to natural language
                commands, the large language model (LLM) is used as the core of
                the robot. By leveraging the LLM&rsquo;s In-context Learning
                (ICL) capability, providing the LLM with some instructive
                examples allows it to autonomously deduce which basic functions
                are needed to execute complex instructions, and to arrange the
                execution order and logical hierarchy of these functions.
                Subsequently, it activates the pre-set functional modules in ROS
                in an orderly manner, thereby efficiently and accurately
                completing the natural language tasks given by the user. Our
                method achieved the highest score in the GPSR project of the
                2023 RoboCup@Home-Open Platform.

                To address the issue of building a high-quality dataset within a
                short race course, we first manually annotated a small dataset
                and trained initial weights. Subsequently, we innovatively used
                an AI engine-driven X-AnyLabeling for semi-automatic annotation
                of a large dataset, avoiding the tedious and inefficient manual
                annotation process. Ultimately, all data will be used for the
                training of YOLOv5.

                Project（2023中国机器人大赛专项赛通用服务机器人赛项）, To
                achieve planar grasping of a robotic arm, a GGCNN (Generative
                Grasping CNN) model is constructed. It takes high-precision
                depth maps captured by RealSense as input and utilizes the
                end-to-end learning mechanism of CNN to output a pixel-level
                grasp pose map. This includes the optimal grasping point,
                grasping width, and rotation angle around the Z-axis. The model
                training enhances the authenticity of the dataset through
                Gaussian noise, thereby improving the grasping accuracy and
                robustness of the robotic arm in complex environments.

                To address the issue of significant geometric distortion of
                targets in panoramic fisheye images, an end-to-end semantic
                segmentation network for panoramic fisheye images,
                FisheyeSegNet, has been constructed. The Multi-Scale Depth
                Aggregation Network (MSDAN), designed with the integration of
                constrained deformable convolution, effectively processes and
                represents multi-scale features, enhancing the network&rsquo;s
                ability to model distortion. The proposed constrained deformable
                convolution and Flexible Attention Module (FAM) establish a
                dynamic receptive field, enhancing the model&rsquo;s ability to
                adaptively capture distorted target features, increasing the
                model&rsquo;s representational capacity, and guiding the network
                to correctly focus on the target objects.
              </p>

                To tackle the problem of data for fisheye vision research, the
                Cubemap algorithm was designed, and the M0rtzzWoodscape
                large-scale semantic segmentation dataset was constructed using
                CARLA. This dataset includes 8000 simulated images with precise
                pixel-level semantic annotations across 24 categories,
                compensating for the lack of large-scale training datasets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Extensive experiments on public datasets such as Woodscape have
                verified the effectiveness and excellent generalization of this
                method. The experiments have been completed, and the paper is
                currently being written.
